									<p class="leading">The Rise of "Echoes of Kidangoor"
										In the heart of Kerala, nestled among the lush greenery and rolling hills, lies the College of Engineering, Kidangoor. Known for its academic excellence and vibrant campus life, the college has always been a melting pot of talent, creativity, and passion. But among the many stories that have emerged from its halls, one stands out—a story of music, friendship, and a shared dream. This is the story of "Echoes of Kidangoor," the college's most beloved band.
									<p>The Humble Beginnings
										It all started in the year 2017, when a group of first-year students, each with a deep love for music, found themselves bonding over their shared passion. Arjun, the charismatic lead vocalist, had a voice that could move mountains. Meera, a prodigy with the guitar, could make the strings sing with just a touch. Then there was Rahul, the drummer with an infectious energy, and Neha, the keyboardist whose melodies could transport listeners to another world. Completing the lineup was Vinay, the bassist, whose deep notes provided the perfect foundation for their sound.
										
										These five students, each from different parts of Kerala, had no idea that their casual jamming sessions in the college's old music room would soon evolve into something much bigger. Initially, they played for fun, covering popular songs and experimenting with different genres. But there was something magical about their chemistry, something that made their music resonate with everyone who heard it.
										
										The First Breakthrough
										Their first big break came during the college's annual cultural festival, "TechnoVibes." With nothing to lose, they decided to enter the music competition. Naming themselves "Echoes of Kidangoor," they took the stage with nervous excitement. The auditorium was packed, and the air was thick with anticipation.
										
										As they started playing, the nerves faded away, replaced by the sheer joy of performing. Their rendition of classic rock anthems mixed with traditional Kerala folk music left the audience spellbound. The energy was electric, and by the time they finished their set, the crowd was on its feet, cheering them on.
										
										"Echoes of Kidangoor" won the competition that night, but more importantly, they won the hearts of their fellow students. From that moment on, they were not just a band—they were the pride of the College of Engineering, Kidangoor.</p>
